# Hyper Text Funya Protocol (HFTP)

HFTP is a playful, RFC-style protocol that responds to HTTP-like requests with "ふにゃふにゃ" messages. This repository contains both the protocol specification in RFC format and a reference implementation for fun experiments.

## Version

Current version: v1.0

## Overview

HFTP is based on HTTP, providing a fun and lightweight way to respond to requests. Inspired by RFC 2324 (HTCPCP), HFTP adds a humorous twist to client-server interactions, returning cheerful "ふにゃふにゃ" messages for GET requests.

## Features

* Responds to HTTP GET requests with "ふにゃふにゃ" messages.
* RFC-style documentation included for reference.
* Easy to extend for experimental fun protocols.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hyper-Text-Funya-Protocol.git
cd Hyper-Text-Funya-Protocol
```

Start the server (example using Python's built-in HTTP server):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the response.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for new funya features, improvements, or additional RFC-style documentation.
